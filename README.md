Sample set up using socket-io to send and receive messages, uses express
as the server.

Followed along the good tutorial here:
http://www.programwitherik.com/getting-started-with-socket-io-node-js-and-express/

with some minor adjustments like adding browserify and pulling out the
javascript into a separate file (main.js)

Run 'npm install' and then 'node app.js'.  Then navigate to
localhost:4200
